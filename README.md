# y-axis
Generates nice rounded tick numbers for a given positive number. 

Javascript + Bootstrap. 

Please use functions chooseStep and buildTicks in your own code. 
Should work for positive numbers down to 0.00001 up to 5.000.000.000. 
Max value for y axis will always be the last value in the array returned by buildTicks. Minimum is always 0.

Feel free to contribute. 

Todo: 
- Add negative numbers 
- Add possibility for another minium than 0. 
- Add a general expression for the 1-2-5 pattern. This will avoid so many if statements.
